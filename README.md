# @learning-hub/markdown

Shared Markdown package for [Learning Hub](https://github.com/vcdas123) — the single source of truth for Markdown-related constants, prompts, slug helpers, parsing, validation, formatting, and types used by both `learning-hub-frontend` and `learning-hub-backend`.

> Note: `package.json`'s `description` field still says "Phase 1: foundation only — no parser/validator logic yet." That's stale — the source has moved well past that; parser, validator, and formatter logic all exist and are in active use by both apps today (see below).

## Purpose

Without a shared package, the format guide, prompt templates, slug/anchor-id generation, parsing/validation logic, and shared type shapes can silently drift between the frontend and backend. This package exists so both apps consume the same implementation instead of maintaining parallel copies.

## Architecture

```txt
learning-hub-frontend
        │
        ▼
@learning-hub/markdown
        ▲
        │
learning-hub-backend
```

Both apps depend on this package (as a GitHub dependency, see Install below) and import from it.

## What it exports

Everything below is re-exported from the package root (`src/index.ts`) and imported as `@learning-hub/markdown`.

- **`constants/`** — `NOTE_FORMAT_GUIDE` (the composed note-format guide object: version, summary, rules, structure, supported blocks, example note, and both prompts), `MARKDOWN_RULES`, `SUPPORTED_BLOCKS` (+ `SupportedBlockType`), `EXAMPLE_MARKDOWN` (the reference example note), and the authoring-rule strings `MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_NOTICE` / `CODE_FENCE_RULE` / `CODE_FENCE_ERROR`.
- **`prompts/`** — `AI_PROMPT` (the "generate a note" prompt template) and `RESTRUCTURE_PROMPT` (the "restructure an existing note" prompt template).
- **`slug/`** — `slugify(text)`, the pure string-transform used for both URL slugs and heading-anchor ids. Note/module slug *generation* (DB-counter/crypto/time dependent) stays in `learning-hub-backend`.
- **`types/`** — `Block`, `Section`, `TocEntry`, `ParsedNote`, and `MarkdownValidationResult`.
- **`parser/`** — `markdownIt` (the configured `markdown-it` instance), `parseMarkdownSource`, `stripBoilerplate`, `tokensToBlocks`, `groupSections`, `buildToc`, and the top-level orchestrator `transformMarkdownTokens(tokens): ParsedNote`.
- **`validator/`** — `validateMarkdownSource(raw, cleaned, tokens)`, the convenience wrapper `validateMarkdown(raw): MarkdownValidationResult` for callers with only raw text (used by the frontend's realtime validation), and `getMarkdownDiagnostics(raw): MarkdownDiagnosticItem[]` — a line-aware companion returning `{ message, severity, line }` items, used to anchor inline editor diagnostics at the correct line instead of defaulting to line 1.
- **`formatter/`** — `formatMarkdown(raw)`, a whitespace/blank-line normalizer (blank line before/after headings and fenced code blocks, collapsed blank-line runs, trimmed trailing whitespace, exactly one trailing newline; fence-aware and idempotent). It never touches note content, only formatting conventions — used by the frontend's "Auto Fix" editor button.

Notes must be complete Markdown (`.md`) documents that follow every rule in `MARKDOWN_RULES` — Learning Hub rejects invalid notes. Every fenced code block must declare its language (` ```sql`, ` ```python`, etc., or ` ```text` if none applies); a bare fenced code block is a blocking validation error.

Tests live in `tests/` (`smoke`, `parser`, `validator`, `formatter`, `getMarkdownDiagnostics`, `stripBoilerplate`) and assert against the reference `EXAMPLE_MARKDOWN` note to catch drift.

## Build / typecheck

```bash
npm run build      # tsc -p tsconfig.json -> dist/
npm run prepare    # runs build (fires automatically on install, since this is a git dependency)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run test       # build, then run tests with node --test against dist/tests/*.test.js
```

Runtime dependency: `markdown-it`. Dev dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `@types/markdown-it`.

## Install / consumption

Both `learning-hub-frontend` and `learning-hub-backend` depend on this package straight from GitHub — not a local workspace or `file:` path:

```json
"@learning-hub/markdown": "github:vcdas123/learning-hub-markdown"
```

`npm install` in either app clones this repo, then runs its `prepare` script (`npm run build`) so `dist/` is generated on install. The package is ESM-only (`"type": "module"`); consumers resolve it through the `exports` field to `dist/src/index.js` / `dist/src/index.d.ts`.

## Usage

```ts
import {
  NOTE_FORMAT_GUIDE,
  SUPPORTED_BLOCKS,
  slugify,
  validateMarkdown,
  formatMarkdown,
  parseMarkdownSource,
  transformMarkdownTokens,
} from "@learning-hub/markdown";

const { tokens } = parseMarkdownSource(rawMarkdown);
const parsedNote = transformMarkdownTokens(tokens);
const { ok, errors, warnings } = validateMarkdown(rawMarkdown);
const formatted = formatMarkdown(rawMarkdown);
const slug = slugify("My Note Title"); // "my-note-title"
```
