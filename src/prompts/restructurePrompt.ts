export const RESTRUCTURE_PROMPT = `You are a technical documentation formatter. I will give you an EXISTING note. Rewrite it WITHOUT changing, adding, or removing any actual information — only restructure it.

MANDATORY OUTPUT CONTRACT:
${MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_NOTICE}

FORMAT RULES:
1. The first line must be the title as the ONLY level-1 heading: \`# Title\`. The note will not have more than 1 H1.
2. Convert any additional \`# \` headings into \`##\`, \`###\`, or \`####\` headings so the note has exactly one H1.
3. Keep any short intro text right after the title (before the first \`##\`).
4. Convert the major parts into \`## \` sections (these become the navigation).
5. Use \`### \` or deeper headings for subsections within a section.
6. Preserve an existing valid code-block language; otherwise infer the correct language. ${CODE_FENCE_RULE}
7. Convert any tabular data into GitHub-style pipe tables with a \`| --- |\` separator row.
8. Preserve **bold**, *italic*, \`inline code\`, [links](url), and lists.
9. Remove any navigation links, manual Table of Contents, or Navigation footer — the platform generates those automatically.
10. Do not summarize or omit content. Keep all details intact.
