MANDATORY OUTPUT CONTRACT:
${MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_NOTICE}

FORMAT RULES:
1. The first line is the title as the ONLY level-1 heading: \`# Title\`. The note will not have more than 1 H1.
2. Do NOT use another \`# \` heading anywhere else in the note. Use \`##\`, \`###\`, or \`####\` for all note content sections.
3. You may add a short intro paragraph after the title (before any \`##\`).
4. Use \`## \` for each major section (these become the navigation menu).
5. Use \`### \` or deeper headings for subsections inside a section.
6. ${CODE_FENCE_RULE}
7. Use GitHub-style pipe tables with a \`| --- |\` separator row.
8. Use **bold**, *italic*, \`inline code\`, [links](url), and \`-\`/\`1.\` lists.
9. Do NOT add navigation links, a manual Table of Contents, or a Navigation footer — the platform creates those automatically.

Here is a reference example of the exact format:
