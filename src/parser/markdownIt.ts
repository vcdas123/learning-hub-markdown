// theory that the platform auto-generates its own navigation, so a
// downloaded-then-reuploaded note might otherwise duplicate it. In practice
// nothing in either app ever generates those patterns (no export/download
// path writes them into note content), so the only real effect was a live
// data-loss bug: the "## Navigation" regex had no line-start anchor, so the
// literal text matching mid-line — e.g. inside inline code in prose that
// merely *discussed* the feature — combined with the `s` (dotAll) flag's
// greedy `.*`, silently deleted everything from that point to the end of
// the note.
//
// Per product decision: never silently strip user content. If a note
// contains something the platform doesn't want (like a manual Table of
// Contents/Navigation section), that's surfaced as a validator
// warning/error instead — see validateMarkdownSource/getMarkdownDiagnostics
// — never deleted out from under the author.
